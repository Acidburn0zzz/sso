              <p>The
                U.S. Board on Geographic Names is a Federal body created in 1890
                and established in its present form by Public Law in 1947 to
                maintain uniform geographic name usage throughout the Federal
                Government. The Board comprises representatives of Federal agencies
                concerned with geographic information, population, ecology, and
                management of public lands. Sharing its responsibilities with
                the Secretary of the Interior, the Board promulgates official
                geographic feature names with locative attributes as well as
                principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of domestic
              names, foreign names, Antarctic names, and undersea feature names.</p>
              <p>The original program of names standardization addressed the
                complex issues of domestic geographic feature names during the
                surge of exploration, mining, and settlement of western territories
                after the American Civil War. Inconsistencies and contradictions
                among many names, spellings, and applications became a serious
                problem to surveyors, map makers, and scientists who required
                uniform, non-conflicting geographic nomenclature. President Benjamin
                Harrison signed an Executive Order establishing the Board and
                giving it authority to resolve unsettled geographic names questions.
                Decisions of the Board were accepted as binding by all departments
                and agencies of the Federal Government.</p>
              <p>The Board gradually expanded its interests to include foreign
                names and other areas of interest to the United States, a process
                that accelerated during World War II. In 1947, the Board was
                recreated by Congress in Public Law 80-242. The usefulness of
                standardizing (not regulating) geographic names has been proven
                time and again, and today more than 50 nations have some type
                of national names authority. The United Nations stated that &quot;the best
                method to achieve international standardization is through strong
                programs of national standardization.&quot; Numerous nations established policies 
                relevant to toponomy (the study of names) in their respective countries.</p>
              <p>In this age of geographic information systems, the Internet,
                and homeland defense, geographic names data are even more important
                and more challenging. Applying the latest technology, the Board
                on Geographic Names continues its mission. It serves the Federal
                Government and the public as a central authority to which name
                problems, name inquiries, name changes, and new name proposals
                can be directed. In partnership with Federal, State, and local
                agencies, the Board provides a conduit through which uniform
                geographic name usage is applied and current names data are promulgated.</p>
              <p>For geographic feature names policies applying to the United
                States, or to the use of foreign geographic names, Antarctica
                names, and undersea feature names by the United States, see the
                respective items in the main menu on the left. Any person or
                organization, public or private, may make inquiries or request
                the Board to render formal decisions on proposed new names, proposed
                name changes, or names that are in conflict. Minutes of the Board's
                meetings are available. Communications concerning the Board should
              be addressed to:</p>
